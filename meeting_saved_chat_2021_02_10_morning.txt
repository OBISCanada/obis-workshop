12:07:31 From  Samantha  to  naomi tress (OTN - facilitator)(Direct Message) : Good morning could you please tell me what I need to have ready and copied over for today?
12:11:31 From  Samantha  to  Everyone : I don't have my own dataset, I was under the impression you could provide one in that case?
12:17:24 From  Jon Pye (OTN - Facilitator)  to  Everyone : https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide/tree/master/Standardizing%20Marine%20Biological%20Data/datasets/example_script_with_fake_data

12:25:05 From  Jon Pye (OTN - Facilitator)  to  Everyone : do try to login to the IPTs and see if your credentials will work
12:26:25 From  Brian Jones (OTN)  to  Everyone : the login for the Demo IPT at 129.173.48.161:8080/ipt/ is your emails and workshop as the password
12:30:12 From  Brian Jones (OTN)  to  Everyone : brb
12:31:44 From  naomi tress (OTN - facilitator)  to  Everyone : "Tough Questions"How do we deal with records where the taxa is not recorded (40 yr old plankton sampling) -Tim Van Der Stap How is eDNA metabarcoding data handled?  Is it considered within OBIS? -Kim HowlandPresence and absence are poorly represented in DwC, where occurrence with an absence of the species in question is represented as an occurrence. - Claude Nozeres When to use MoF vs. sex/lifestage entries in occurrences, what about with abundance measurements? - Tim Van Der Staap What is the benefit of sharing extra details about sampling regimes etc etc, when most of the existing data doesn’t have this level of precision?  - Zach MonteithAssociating the measurements of only some fish subsampled from a catch event, i.e. selections for further examination
12:31:52 From  Samantha  to  naomi tress (OTN - facilitator)(Direct Message) : I'm trying to access the fake data, it's a .csv, but copies over as a link if I drag it into a folder. If I open it and fork it, it copies as a single cell into a spreadsheet.  Can you give me a hand?
12:32:02 From  naomi tress (OTN - facilitator)  to  Everyone : probably will let tim speak for himself...
12:32:39 From  Tim Van Der Stap  to  Everyone : We asked the question on SBMD Slack Group, and Abby mentioned that she had previously worked on this dataset that might be insightful: https://www.gbif.org/dataset/91641b5c-7afa-4262-9fe0-d22d067ce299
12:32:53 From  Tim Van Der Stap  to  Everyone : But unfortunately she couldn't figure out anymore how she did it exactly
12:33:18 From  naomi tress (OTN - facilitator)  to  Jon Pye (OTN - Facilitator)(Direct Message) : can you move me to breakout room 1 pls
12:34:56 From  naomi tress (OTN - facilitator)  to  Samantha(Direct Message) : I messed up the breakout rooms, can you come back to the main?
12:35:45 From  naomi tress (OTN - facilitator)  to  Samantha(Direct Message) : i know what you need to do, or at least what worked for me with that before, if you know how to rename a file in the file explorer, you can change the file ending to .csv
12:35:57 From  naomi tress (OTN - facilitator)  to  Samantha(Direct Message) : ignore the warning and open the file as jon instructed you
12:36:46 From  Samantha  to  naomi tress (OTN - facilitator)(Direct Message) : OK I'll try that.
12:43:28 From  Johan Jung  to  Everyone : Fortran.. it's been a while I heard that. haha reminds me of the name Cobol … I was learning Python, is there any IDE looking good as RStudio for Python?
12:45:02 From  Jon Pye (OTN - Facilitator)  to  Everyone : Spyder, PyCharm, VS Code are all good IDEs
12:45:09 From  Johan Jung  to  Everyone : thanks!
12:45:10 From  Jon Pye (OTN - Facilitator)  to  Everyone : Atom and VSCode are good and language agnostic
12:45:51 From  naomi tress (OTN - facilitator)  to  Samantha(Direct Message) : let me know if that doesn't work, we will try something else
12:50:09 From  Jon Pye (OTN - Facilitator)  to  Everyone : pardon my eating, lunch hour here  :)

13:24:26 From  Brett Johnson  to  Everyone : For resource contact I often use the main author and then add another resource contact that is just data@hakai.org…
13:26:07 From  claudenozeres  to  Everyone : unicorn? :)
13:27:19 From  Tim Van Der Stap  to  Everyone : I thought he was building up the suspense for a second lhere
13:27:58 From  naomi tress (OTN - facilitator)  to  Everyone : equus monocornus?
13:50:19 From  Janet Mossman  to  Everyone : I would be interested in the code
13:50:37 From  naomi tress (OTN - facilitator)  to  Everyone : thanks janet
14:10:32 From  Jon Pye (OTN - Facilitator)  to  Everyone : https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.620702/full
14:11:45 From  Jon Pye (OTN - Facilitator)  to  Everyone : identificationRemarks is the field for us from our convo yesterday
14:14:20 From  Maria Cornthwaite  to  Everyone : https://www.goosocean.org/
14:14:29 From  Jon Pye (OTN - Facilitator)  to  Everyone : https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14&Itemid=114
14:15:33 From  Maria Cornthwaite  to  Everyone : Also this - https://cioos.ca/.  I believe we have folk at the Institute of Ocean Sciences involved.
14:17:23 From  Janet Mossman  to  Everyone : yes will datasets be published multiple times or will they simply kink to each other?
14:17:31 From  Janet Mossman  to  Everyone : link lol
14:21:19 From  Janet Mossman  to  Everyone : will cioos be checking to ensure that there is not duplication between online databases for the same dataset which may be hosted in multiple locations?
14:22:38 From  Jeff Cullis  to  Everyone : we'd essentially be relying on OBIS Canada to ensure there isn't duplication - that would be the first place incoming data to CIOOS would go
14:22:50 From  claudenozeres  to  Everyone : Ah! The 2 IPTs in OBIS Canada are VLIZ (Belgium) and CMN (Ottawa): http://ipt.nature.ca/  https://obis.org/node/7dfb2d90-9317-434d-8d4e-64adf324579a
14:23:15 From  Janet Mossman  to  Everyone : Will CIOOS not be linking to additional online databases other than OBIS?
14:23:30 From  claudenozeres  to  Everyone : good q.
14:23:44 From  Janet Mossman  to  Everyone : like open data Canada?
14:27:07 From  Tim Van Der Stap  to  Everyone : Building once, publishing multiple times.. I like that
14:29:12 From  Amy Tabata  to  Everyone : does goos use the Darwin core terms where they overlap?
14:29:19 From  Jon Pye (OTN - Facilitator)  to  Everyone : once upon a time, ERDDAP was able to read data layers from an IPT. There's legacy code around it.
14:30:21 From  Jon Pye (OTN - Facilitator)  to  Everyone : Amy: it's operating a level beyond that, it's looking for data quality standards and I would say DarwinCore family of standards is one way to arrive at those standards.
14:33:51 From  Tim Van Der Stap  to  Everyone : GOOS is more of a framework identifying what some of the core parameters are to measure the ocean (EOV - essential ocean variables) and how these parameters can best be measured, following best practices. It's not really a data repository where you can search for datasets
14:53:13 From  Heidi van Vliet (DFO)  to  Everyone : Winter had found the island... its snowing in Nanaimo!
14:53:33 From  claudenozeres  to  Everyone : can do local hill boarding!

15:22:38 From  Janet Mossman  to  Everyone : does obis incorporate datasets with some privacy filters at all if the owner doesn't want all of the dataset shared such as specific locations?
15:23:16 From  naomi tress (OTN - facilitator)  to  Everyone : you could adjust the data record, dataGeneralization
15:24:02 From  Janet Mossman  to  Everyone : is there any way that obis can control the download of datasets?
15:24:41 From  Janet Mossman  to  Everyone : does it specify who is downloading the data?
15:25:30 From  claudenozeres  to  Everyone : Not sure—but if by web portal, you have to provide your email, so that would be a records
15:26:04 From  Janet Mossman  to  Everyone : thanks
15:27:05 From  Janet Mossman  to  Everyone : can obis host metadata and link to another forum without hosting the dataset itself?
15:27:51 From  claudenozeres  to  Everyone : Example: http://ipt.iobis.org/obiscanada/resource?r=dfo_pac_lingcodscuba_sog

15:54:15 From  Janet Mossman  to  Everyone : so im curious about how the datasets hosted by slgo are linked to obis? is it just the metadata?
15:54:50 From  claudenozeres  to  Everyone : For biodiversity, currently are duplicates (for DFO).
15:54:56 From  claudenozeres  to  Everyone : Not DwC.
