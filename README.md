## OBIS, DarwinCore, and IPTs Workshop -

This workshop has been adapted from the standard 4.5 day OBIS training workshop and is aimed at researchers and data professionals who may be creating or aggregating biological presence data with a desire to report that data to OBIS via their national OBIS Node. 



#### Facilitators
**Name** - *(home OBIS node)* - email

Many thanks to Ward Appeltans, Leen Vandepitte, Pieter Provoost, Daphnis De Pooter, Abby Benson and all those throughout the OBIS community who helped build and refine the source material used in assembling this workshop. We hope that our adaptation is useful, fit for purpose, and results in productive outcomes for all prospective OBIS contributors.


### Goals of the Workshop:

Give attendees an idea of what OBIS is and how it functions, why and how to become compliant with OBIS data and metadata formatting and data policy, how OBIS reporting pipelines work. Allow time to investigate solutions to meeting OBIS-compliance from user-held datasets and work in groups with support from trained bioinformaticians to produce DarwinCore archives fit for ingestion into OBIS nodes, especially OBIS-Canada 

Highlight the utility of providing data to OBIS Canada (and onward to OBIS), learn how to create 
Darwin Core Archives.  

Provide our own institutionally held project data and metadata in EML/DwC-A format to OBIS Canada for publication/aggregation.  

Deliver curriculum via OceanTeacher Global Academy and/or GitHub to provide a permanent resource for users to refer back to.
