], "answer_text": "You should provide the taxon name as recorded in the dataset even if it is not the valid name. OBIS uses WoRMS as it’s taxonomic backbone and can get the accepted name an all other taxonomic information from there. Using the original name ensures traceability (you store the same as the one which was originally recorded). Moreover taxonomy is not stable: a taxon name which is considered to be an invalid synonym of one species to today, may be a valid taxon name tomorrow; using the original name ensures that you don’t need to modify the dataset every time taxonomy changes.","correct_answer":1},
