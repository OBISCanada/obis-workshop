## How to establish baselines of invasive species?

One use of occurrence data is having records of species that change at times and places. Examples include the green crab (Carcinus maenas), violet tunicates (Botrylloides violaceus), and another tunicate â€” Ciona intestinalis. With global warming, one might expect to find that these species may spread north. 

Using OBIS environmental records, examine the temperature and occurrence records of Ciona intestinalis. One record appears in the Arctic. Is there evidence to refute it?

*Tip: Is there evidence for a related, but endemic species in the region?*

**Bonus:** contact data source of Ciona record for more information or updates.
**Bonus:** repeat exercise with Botrylloides violaceus.
