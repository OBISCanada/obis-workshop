On the deep-water coral page on Wikipedia we read this:

> The habitat of deep-water corals, also known as cold-water corals, extends to deeper, darker parts of the oceans than tropical corals, ranging from near the surface to the abyss, beyond 2,000 metres where water temperatures may be as cold as 4 Â°C. Deep-water corals belong to the Phylum Cnidaria and are most often stony corals (Scleractinia), but also include black and horny corals (Antipatharia) and soft corals (Alcyonacea) including the Gorgonians.


**For this assignment:**

Use robis to retrieve deep-water coral occurrences below 2000 m from OBIS
Find how the occurrences are distributed among the different orders
